"A student measured the height of a pole as $5.98 ~m$ which is less than the actual height. If the percentage error is $5\%$, find correct to two decimal places the actual height of the pole. \\ Possible answers: \\ A. $6.29 ~m$ \\ B. $7.67 ~m$ \\ C. $7.18 ~m$ \\ D. $6.65 ~m$ \\ Correct answer: A" \\ \textbf{Solution.} The student measured the height of a pole as \(5.98 \, \text{m}\), which is less than the actual height. The percentage error is given as \(5\%\). To find the actual height, we use the formula for percentage error: \\ \[ \\ \text{Percentage Error} = \left( \frac{\text{Actual Height} - \text{Measured Height}}{\text{Actual Height}} \right) \times 100 \\ \] \\ Given the percentage error is \(5\%\), we set up the equation: \\ \[ \\ 5 = \left( \frac{H - 5.98}{H} \right) \times 100 \\ \] \\ Solving for \(H\): \\ \[ \\ 0.05 = \frac{H - 5.98}{H} \\ \] \\ Multiplying both sides by \(H\): \\ \[ \\ 0.05H = H - 5.98 \\ \] \\ Rearranging terms: \\ \[ \\ H - 0.05H = 5.98 \\ \] \\ \[ \\ 0.95H = 5.98 \\ \] \\ \[ \\ H = \frac{5.98}{0.95} \\ \] \\ Performing the division: \\ \[ \\ H \approx 6.2947 \\ \] \\ Rounding to two decimal places, the actual height is \(6.29 \, \text{m}\). \\ Thus, the correct answer is \(\boxed{A}\).
