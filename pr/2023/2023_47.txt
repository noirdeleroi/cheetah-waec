"If $2 x-3 y=-11$ and $3 x+2 y=3$, evaluate $(y-x)^2$. \\ Possible answers: \\ A. $16$ \\ B. $25$ \\ C. $9$ \\ D. $4$ \\ Correct answer: A" \\ \textbf{Solution.} To solve the system of equations \(2x - 3y = -11\) and \(3x + 2y = 3\), we use the elimination method. \\ First, we multiply the equations to align the coefficients of \(x\): \\ 1. Multiply the first equation by 3: \(6x - 9y = -33\) \\ 2. Multiply the second equation by 2: \(6x + 4y = 6\) \\ Subtract the first modified equation from the second modified equation: \\ \[ \\ (6x + 4y) - (6x - 9y) = 6 - (-33) \\ \] \\ Simplifying the left side: \\ \[ \\ 6x + 4y - 6x + 9y = 13y \\ \] \\ Simplifying the right side: \\ \[ \\ 6 + 33 = 39 \\ \] \\ This gives: \\ \[ \\ 13y = 39 \implies y = 3 \\ \] \\ Substitute \(y = 3\) back into the second original equation \(3x + 2y = 3\): \\ \[ \\ 3x + 2(3) = 3 \implies 3x + 6 = 3 \implies 3x = -3 \implies x = -1 \\ \] \\ Thus, the solutions are \(x = -1\) and \(y = 3\). Evaluating \((y - x)^2\): \\ \[ \\ (3 - (-1))^2 = (3 + 1)^2 = 4^2 = 16 \\ \] \\ The final answer is \(\boxed{A}\).
