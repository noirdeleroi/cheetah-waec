"The interior angle of a regular polygon is $6$ times its exterior angle, find the number of sides of the polygon. \\ Possible answers: \\ A. $12$ \\ B. $15$ \\ C. $10$ \\ D. $14$ \\ Correct answer: D" \\ \textbf{Solution.} Let the measure of the exterior angle be \( x \) degrees. Then the interior angle would be \( 6x \) degrees. Since the interior angle and the exterior angle are supplementary, we have: \\ \[ \\ 6x + x = 180^\circ \\ \] \\ Solving for \( x \): \\ \[ \\ 7x = 180^\circ \implies x = \frac{180^\circ}{7} \approx 25.714^\circ \\ \] \\ The number of sides \( n \) of a regular polygon is given by dividing the sum of all exterior angles (360 degrees) by the measure of one exterior angle: \\ \[ \\ n = \frac{360^\circ}{x} = \frac{360^\circ}{\frac{180^\circ}{7}} = 360^\circ \times \frac{7}{180^\circ} = 2 \times 7 = 14 \\ \] \\ We can also verify this using the formula for the interior angle of a regular polygon. The interior angle is given by: \\ \[ \\ \frac{(n - 2) \times 180^\circ}{n} \\ \] \\ Since the interior angle is 6 times the exterior angle: \\ \[ \\ \frac{(n - 2) \times 180^\circ}{n} = 6 \times \frac{360^\circ}{n} \\ \] \\ Multiplying both sides by \( n \): \\ \[ \\ (n - 2) \times 180^\circ = 6 \times 360^\circ \\ \] \\ Simplifying the right side: \\ \[ \\ (n - 2) \times 180^\circ = 2160^\circ \\ \] \\ Dividing both sides by 180Â°: \\ \[ \\ n - 2 = \frac{2160^\circ}{180^\circ} = 12 \\ \] \\ Thus: \\ \[ \\ n = 12 + 2 = 14 \\ \] \\ Both methods confirm that the number of sides is 14. Therefore, the final answer is: \\ \[ \\ \boxed{D} \\ \]
