"The truth set of $8+2 x-x^2=0$ is $\{p, q\}$. Evaluate $p+q$. \\ Possible answers: \\ A. $4$ \\ B. $2$ \\ C. $-6$ \\ D. $-2$ \\ Correct answer: B" \\ \textbf{Solution.} To find the truth set of the equation \(8 + 2x - x^2 = 0\), we first rewrite it in standard quadratic form. Multiplying both sides by -1, we get: \\ \[ \\ x^2 - 2x - 8 = 0 \\ \] \\ Next, we factor the quadratic equation. We look for two numbers that multiply to -8 and add to -2. These numbers are 2 and -4. Thus, the equation factors as: \\ \[ \\ (x + 2)(x - 4) = 0 \\ \] \\ The solutions are \(x = -2\) and \(x = 4\). Therefore, the truth set is \(\{-2, 4\}\). Adding these roots together: \\ \[ \\ -2 + 4 = 2 \\ \] \\ We can also use Vieta's formulas, which state that the sum of the roots of a quadratic equation \(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\) is \(-b/a\). Here, \(a = 1\) and \(b = -2\), so the sum of the roots is: \\ \[ \\ -\left(\frac{-2}{1}\right) = 2 \\ \] \\ Thus, the final answer is \(\boxed{B}\).
