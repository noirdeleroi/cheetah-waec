"A number is chosen at random from $40$ and $50$ inclusive. Find the probability that the number is prime. \\ Possible answers: \\ A. $\frac{8}{11}$ \\ B. $\frac{3}{11}$ \\ C. $\frac{4}{11}$ \\ D. $\frac{5}{11}$ \\ Correct answer: B" \\ \textbf{Solution.} To find the probability that a number chosen at random from 40 to 50 inclusive is prime, we first determine the total number of numbers in this range. The numbers are 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, which gives us a total of 11 numbers. \\ Next, we identify the prime numbers within this range. A prime number is a number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. Checking each number: \\ - 40: Not prime (divisible by 2, 4, 5, etc.) \\ - 41: Prime (no divisors other than 1 and 41) \\ - 42: Not prime (divisible by 2) \\ - 43: Prime (no divisors other than 1 and 43) \\ - 44: Not prime (divisible by 2) \\ - 45: Not prime (divisible by 5 and 9) \\ - 46: Not prime (divisible by 2) \\ - 47: Prime (no divisors other than 1 and 47) \\ - 48: Not prime (divisible by 2) \\ - 49: Not prime (divisible by 7) \\ - 50: Not prime (divisible by 2 and 5) \\ The prime numbers are 41, 43, and 47, giving us 3 prime numbers. \\ The probability is the number of prime numbers divided by the total number of numbers, which is \(\frac{3}{11}\). \\ Thus, the final answer is \(\boxed{B}\).
