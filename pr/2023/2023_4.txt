"There are $30$ students in a class; $15$ study woodwork and $13$ study metal work; $6$ study neither of the $2$ subjects. How many student study woodwork but not metal work?\" \\ \\ Correct answer: \\ B" \\ \textbf{Solution.} Given there are 30 students in a class, where 15 study woodwork, 13 study metalwork, and 6 study neither subject, we need to find the number of students who study woodwork but not metalwork. \\ First, we calculate the number of students who study at least one of the subjects: \\ \[ \\ 30 - 6 = 24 \\ \] \\ Using the principle of inclusion-exclusion for sets, we denote: \\ - \( |W| \) as the number of students studying woodwork (15), \\ - \( |M| \) as the number of students studying metalwork (13), \\ - \( |W \cup M| \) as the number of students studying at least one subject (24), \\ - \( |W \cap M| \) as the number of students studying both subjects. \\ \begin{figure}[ht] \\ \centering \\ \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{/home/alex/Downloads/pics_waec/latex_code_solutions/2023_S_4.png} \\ \caption{} \\ \label{fig:1} \\ \end{figure} \\ The formula for the union of two sets is: \\ \[ \\ |W \cup M| = |W| + |M| - |W \cap M| \\ \] \\ Plugging in the known values: \\ \[ \\ 24 = 15 + 13 - |W \cap M| \\ \] \\ Solving for \( |W \cap M| \): \\ \[ \\ 24 = 28 - |W \cap M| \implies |W \cap M| = 28 - 24 = 4 \\ \] \\ The number of students studying woodwork but not metalwork is the total number of woodwork students minus those studying both: \\ \[ \\ |W| - |W \cap M| = 15 - 4 = 11 \\ \] \\ Thus, the number of students who study woodwork but not metalwork is \(\boxed{11}\).
