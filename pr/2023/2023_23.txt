"An empty cylindrical tank is $140 ~cm$ in diameter. If $200$ litres of water was poured into the tank. Calculate, correct to the nearest centimeter, the height of the water in the tank. $\left(\right.$ Take $\pi=\frac{22}{7}$) \\ Possible answers: \\ A. $91 ~cm$ \\ B. $7 ~cm$ \\ C. $13 ~cm$ \\ D. $57 ~cm$ \\ Correct answer: C" \\ \textbf{Solution.} The diameter of the cylindrical tank is 140 cm, so the radius is \(70\) cm. The volume of water poured into the tank is 200 liters, which converts to \(200,000\) cubic centimeters (since \(1\) liter = \(1000\) cubic centimeters). \\ The formula for the volume of a cylinder is \(V = \pi r^2 h\). Substituting the known values: \\ \[ \\ 200,000 = \left(\frac{22}{7}\right) \times (70)^2 \times h \\ \] \\ First, calculate \(70^2\): \\ \[ \\ 70^2 = 4900 \\ \] \\ Next, substitute this back into the equation: \\ \[ \\ 200,000 = \left(\frac{22}{7}\right) \times 4900 \times h \\ \] \\ Simplify \(\left(\frac{22}{7}\right) \times 4900\): \\ \[ \\ \frac{22}{7} \times 4900 = 22 \times 700 = 15,400 \\ \] \\ Now the equation is: \\ \[ \\ 200,000 = 15,400 \times h \\ \] \\ Solving for \(h\): \\ \[ \\ h = \frac{200,000}{15,400} \approx 12.987 \\ \] \\ Rounding to the nearest centimeter gives \(h \approx 13\) cm. \\ Thus, the height of the water in the tank is \(\boxed{C}\).
