"One-third of the sum of two numbers is $12$, twice their difference is $12$. Find the numbers. \\ Possible answers: \\ A. $22$ and $14$ \\ B. $20$ and $16$ \\ C. $21$ and $15$ \\ D. $23$ and $13$ \\ Correct answer: C" \\ \textbf{Solution.} Let the two numbers be \( x \) and \( y \). \\ The first condition states that one-third of the sum of the two numbers is 12: \\ \[ \\ \frac{1}{3}(x + y) = 12 \\ \] \\ Multiplying both sides by 3, we get: \\ \[ \\ x + y = 36 \\ \] \\ The second condition states that twice their difference is 12: \\ \[ \\ 2(x - y) = 12 \\ \] \\ Dividing both sides by 2, we get: \\ \[ \\ x - y = 6 \\ \] \\ We now have the system of equations: \\ 1. \( x + y = 36 \) \\ 2. \( x - y = 6 \) \\ Adding these two equations: \\ \[ \\ (x + y) + (x - y) = 36 + 6 \\ \] \\ \[ \\ 2x = 42 \\ \] \\ \[ \\ x = 21 \\ \] \\ Substituting \( x = 21 \) back into the first equation: \\ \[ \\ 21 + y = 36 \\ \] \\ \[ \\ y = 15 \\ \] \\ Thus, the numbers are 21 and 15. Verifying the conditions: \\ - The sum is \( 21 + 15 = 36 \), and one-third of 36 is 12. \\ - The difference is \( 21 - 15 = 6 \), and twice 6 is 12. \\ Both conditions are satisfied, so the answer is \(\boxed{C}\).
