"Mr Manu is $4$ times as old as his son, Adu; $7$ years ago the sum of their ages was $76$. How old is Adu? \\ Possible answers: \\ A. $22$ years \\ B. $12$ years \\ C. $18$ years \\ D. $15$ years \\ Correct answer: C" \\ \textbf{Solution.} Let \( x \) be Adu's current age. According to the problem, Mr. Manu is 4 times as old as Adu, so Mr. Manu's current age is \( 4x \). \\ Seven years ago, Adu's age was \( x - 7 \) and Mr. Manu's age was \( 4x - 7 \). The sum of their ages 7 years ago is given as 76. We can set up the equation: \\ \[ \\ (x - 7) + (4x - 7) = 76 \\ \] \\ Simplifying the equation: \\ \[ \\ x + 4x - 7 - 7 = 76 \\ \] \\ \[ \\ 5x - 14 = 76 \\ \] \\ Adding 14 to both sides: \\ \[ \\ 5x = 90 \\ \] \\ Dividing both sides by 5: \\ \[ \\ x = 18 \\ \] \\ Thus, Adu is currently 18 years old. Verifying, if Adu is 18, Mr. Manu is \( 4 \times 18 = 72 \). Seven years ago, Adu was \( 18 - 7 = 11 \) and Mr. Manu was \( 72 - 7 = 65 \). The sum of their ages then is \( 11 + 65 = 76 \), which matches the given information. \\ Therefore, the correct answer is \(\boxed{C}\).
