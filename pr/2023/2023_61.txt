Then, the number of sides of \( P \) is \( 2n \). \\ - The exterior angle of \( Q \) is \( \frac{360^\circ}{n} \) and the exterior angle of \( P \) is \( \frac{360^\circ}{2n} \). \\ - The difference between these exterior angles is given by: \\ \[ \\ \frac{360}{n} - \frac{360}{2n} = 45 \\ \] \\ Simplifying this equation: \\ \[ \\ \frac{360 - 180}{n} = 45 \implies \frac{180}{n} = 45 \implies n = \frac{180}{45} = 4 \\ \] \\ - Therefore, the number of sides of \( Q \) is 4, and the number of sides of \( P \) is \( 2 \times 4 = 8 \). \\ The number of sides of \( P \) is \(\boxed{8}\). \\ Given the area of a semi-circle is \( 32\pi \, \text{cm}^2 \): \\ - The area of a semi-circle is \(\frac{1}{2} \pi r^2\). Setting up the equation: \\ \[ \\ \frac{1}{2} \pi r^2 = 32\pi \\ \] \\ Solving for \( r \): \\ \[ \\ \frac{1}{2} r^2 = 32 \implies r^2 = 64 \implies r = 8 \, \text{cm} \\ \] \\ - The circumference of the semi-circle is the sum of half the circumference of a full circle and the diameter: \\ \[ \\ \pi r + 2r = \pi \times 8 + 2 \times 8 = 8\pi + 16 \\ \] \\ - Representing this as \( a\pi + b \), the values are \( a = 8 \) and \( b = 16 \). \\ The answer is \(\boxed{8,16}\).
