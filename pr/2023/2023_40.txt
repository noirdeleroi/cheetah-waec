"Solve: $\log _3 x+\log _3(x-8)=2$. \\ Possible answers: \\ A. $8$ \\ B. $6$ \\ C. $9$ \\ D. $7$ \\ Correct answer: C" \\ \textbf{Solution.} To solve the equation \(\log_3 x + \log_3(x - 8) = 2\): \\ 1. **Combine the logarithms** using the product rule: \\ \[ \\ \log_3[x(x - 8)] = 2 \\ \] \\ Simplifies to: \\ \[ \\ \log_3(x^2 - 8x) = 2 \\ \] \\ 2. **Convert to exponential form**: \\ \[ \\ 3^2 = x^2 - 8x \implies 9 = x^2 - 8x \\ \] \\ 3. **Form a quadratic equation**: \\ \[ \\ x^2 - 8x - 9 = 0 \\ \] \\ 4. **Factor the quadratic**: \\ \[ \\ (x + 1)(x - 9) = 0 \\ \] \\ Solutions: \(x = -1\) or \(x = 9\). \\ 5. **Check validity**: \\ - \(x = -1\) is invalid (logarithm of a negative number). \\ - \(x = 9\) is valid since \(\log_3 9 = 2\) and \(\log_3(9 - 8) = \log_3 1 = 0\), satisfying \(2 + 0 = 2\). \\ 6. **Verify answer choices**: \\ Only \(x = 9\) (Option C) is valid, as \(x > 8\) is required for the logarithms to be defined. \\ **Answer:** \(\boxed{C}\)
