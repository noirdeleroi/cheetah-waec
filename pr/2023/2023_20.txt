"The radius of a sphere is $3 ~cm$. Find, in terms of $\pi$, its volume. \\ Possible answers: \\ A. $30 \pi \mathrm{~cm}^3$ \\ B. $108 \pi \mathrm{~cm}^3$ \\ C. $27 \pi \mathrm{~cm}^3$ \\ D. $36 \pi \mathrm{~cm}^3$ \\ Correct answer: D" \\ \textbf{Solution.} To find the volume of a sphere with a radius of 3 cm, we use the formula for the volume of a sphere, which is \( V = \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3 \). \\ 1. Substitute the given radius \( r = 3 \) cm into the formula: \\ \[ \\ V = \frac{4}{3} \pi (3)^3 \\ \] \\ 2. Calculate the cube of the radius: \\ \[ \\ (3)^3 = 27 \\ \] \\ 3. Multiply this result by \(\frac{4}{3}\): \\ \[ \\ \frac{4}{3} \times 27 = \frac{4 \times 27}{3} = \frac{108}{3} = 36 \\ \] \\ 4. Therefore, the volume of the sphere is: \\ \[ \\ V = 36 \pi \ \text{cm}^3 \\ \] \\ The correct answer is \(\boxed{D}\).
