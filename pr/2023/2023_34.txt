Calculate in cm the height of the triangle. \\ Possible answers: \\ A. $5$ \\ B. $\sqrt{5}$ \\ C. $3$ \\ D. $\sqrt{3}$ \\ Correct answer: D" \\ \textbf{Solution.} The height of an equilateral triangle with a side length of 2 cm can be calculated using the Pythagorean theorem. Splitting the triangle into two right-angled triangles, the base of each is 1 cm (half of 2 cm), the hypotenuse is 2 cm, and the height \( h \) is the unknown. Applying the theorem: \\ \[ \\ 2^2 = 1^2 + h^2 \implies 4 = 1 + h^2 \implies h^2 = 3 \implies h = \sqrt{3} \, \text{cm}. \\ \] \\ **Answer:** D. \(\sqrt{3}\)
