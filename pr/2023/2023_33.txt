"Factorize completely: $x^{2}-(y+z)^{2}$. \\ Possible answers: \\ A. $(x-y-z)(x-y-z)$ \\ B. $(x+y+z)(x-y-z)$ \\ C. $(x+y+z)(x+y-z)$ \\ D. $(x+y-z)(x-y+z)$ \\ Correct answer: B" \\ \textbf{Solution.} The expression \( x^{2} - (y + z)^{2} \) is a difference of squares, which factors as \( (a - b)(a + b) \) where \( a = x \) and \( b = y + z \). Applying this: \\ \[ \\ x^{2} - (y + z)^{2} = (x - (y + z))(x + (y + z)) = (x - y - z)(x + y + z). \\ \] \\ This matches option **B**, as the order of factors does not affect the product. \\ **Answer:** B. \((x+y+z)(x-y-z)\)
