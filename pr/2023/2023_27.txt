"A line $L$ passing through the point $(6,-13)$ is parallel to the line which passes through $(7,4)$ and $(-3,9)$. Find the equation of the line $L$. \\ Possible answers: \\ A. $y=\frac{1}{2} x-10$ \\ B. $\mathrm{y}=\frac{-1}{2} x+10$ \\ C. $y=\frac{-1}{2} x-10$ \\ D. $y=\frac{1}{2} x+10$ \\ Correct answer: C" \\ \textbf{Solution.} To find the equation of the line \( L \) passing through the point \((6, -13)\) and parallel to the line through \((7, 4)\) and \((-3, 9)\): \\ 1. **Calculate the slope of the line passing through \((7, 4)\) and \((-3, 9)\)**: \\ \[ \\ \text{slope} = \frac{9 - 4}{-3 - 7} = \frac{5}{-10} = -\frac{1}{2} \\ \] \\ Since parallel lines have the same slope, the slope of line \( L \) is also \(-\frac{1}{2}\). \\ 2. **Use the point-slope form to find the equation of line \( L \)**: \\ The point-slope formula is \( y - y_1 = m(x - x_1) \). Substituting \( m = -\frac{1}{2} \), \( x_1 = 6 \), and \( y_1 = -13 \): \\ \[ \\ y - (-13) = -\frac{1}{2}(x - 6) \\ \] \\ Simplifying this: \\ \[ \\ y + 13 = -\frac{1}{2}x + 3 \\ \] \\ Subtract 13 from both sides: \\ \[ \\ y = -\frac{1}{2}x + 3 - 13 \\ \] \\ \[ \\ y = -\frac{1}{2}x - 10 \\ \] \\ 3. **Verify the solution**: \\ - The slope \(-\frac{1}{2}\) is correct. \\ - Checking the point \((6, -13)\) in the equation \( y = -\frac{1}{2}x - 10 \): \\ \[ \\ -\frac{1}{2}(6) - 10 = -3 - 10 = -13 \\ \] \\ Thus, the equation of line \( L \) is \( y = -\frac{1}{2}x - 10 \), which corresponds to option C. \\ \[ \\ \boxed{C} \\ \]
