"A. In a football match, tickets for children and adults were sold at $D3.00$ and $D5.00$ respectively. If $400$ people attended a football match and $D1700.00$ was collected in ticket sales. How many tickets were sold to adults? \\ B. Mr Johnson sold $250$ tickets. If $175$ of the tickets were for adults, how much sales did he make altogether?\" \\ \\ Correct answer: \\ 250\\ Correct answer: \\  1100" \\ \textbf{Solution.} To solve problem A, we need to determine the number of adult tickets sold. Let \( C \) be the number of child tickets and \( A \) be the number of adult tickets. We have the following system of equations: \\ \[ \\ \begin{cases} \\ C + A = 400 \\ \\ 3C + 5A = 1700 \\ \end{cases} \\ \] \\ Solving the first equation for \( C \): \\ \[ \\ C = 400 - A \\ \] \\ Substituting this into the second equation: \\ \[ \\ 3(400 - A) + 5A = 1700 \\ \] \\ Simplifying: \\ \[ \\ 1200 - 3A + 5A = 1700 \\ \\ 1200 + 2A = 1700 \\ \\ 2A = 500 \\ \\ A = 250 \\ \] \\ Thus, the number of adult tickets sold is \(\boxed{250}\). \\ For problem B, Mr. Johnson sold 250 tickets with 175 being adult tickets. The number of child tickets sold is: \\ \[ \\ 250 - 175 = 75 \\ \] \\ Calculating the total sales: \\ - Sales from adult tickets: \( 175 \times 5 = 875 \) \\ - Sales from child tickets: \( 75 \times 3 = 225 \) \\ Adding these together: \\ \[ \\ 875 + 225 = 1100 \\ \] \\ Thus, the total sales made is \(\boxed{1100}\).
