"Mrs Kebeh stands at a distance of $110 ~m$ away from a building of vertical height $58 ~m$. If Kebeh is $2 ~m$ tall, find the angle of elevation of the top of the building from her eye. \\ Possible answers: \\ A. 27$^{\circ}$ \\ B. 28$^{\circ}$ \\ C. 20$^{\circ}$ \\ D. 26$^{\circ}$ \\ Correct answer: A" \\ \textbf{Solution.} Mrs. Kebeh is standing 110 meters away from a building that is 58 meters tall. Since she is 2 meters tall, the vertical height from her eye level to the top of the building is \(58 - 2 = 56\) meters. To find the angle of elevation, we use the tangent function in the right triangle formed by her horizontal distance to the building and the vertical height difference. \\ The tangent of the angle of elevation \(\theta\) is given by: \\ \[ \\ \tan(\theta) = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{adjacent}} = \frac{56}{110} \approx 0.5091 \\ \] \\ \begin{figure}[ht] \\ \centering \\ \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{/home/alex/Downloads/pics_waec/latex_code_solutions/2023_S_35.png} \\ \caption{} \\ \label{fig:1} \\ \end{figure} \\ Using a calculator to find the arctangent of 0.5091, we find that it is approximately 27 degrees. The closest answer from the given options is 27Â°, which corresponds to option A. \\ \[ \\ \boxed{A} \\ \]
