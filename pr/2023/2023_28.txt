"A bag contains $4$ white marbles and $3$ blue marbles. Another bag contains $5$ red marbles and 6 blue marbles. If a marble is picked at random from each bag, find the probability that they are of the same colour. \\ Possible answers: \\ A. $\frac{9}{11}$ \\ B. $\frac{18}{77}$ \\ C. $\frac{1}{2}$ \\ D. $\frac{11}{12}$ \\ Correct answer: B" \\ \textbf{Solution.} To find the probability that two marbles picked at random from each bag are of the same color, we need to consider the overlapping color between the two bags. \\ The first bag contains 4 white marbles and 3 blue marbles, totaling 7 marbles. The probability of picking a blue marble from the first bag is: \\ \[ \\ \frac{3}{7} \\ \] \\ The second bag contains 5 red marbles and 6 blue marbles, totaling 11 marbles. The probability of picking a blue marble from the second bag is: \\ \[ \\ \frac{6}{11} \\ \] \\ Since the only common color between the two bags is blue, the probability that both marbles picked are blue is the product of the individual probabilities: \\ \[ \\ \frac{3}{7} \times \frac{6}{11} = \frac{18}{77} \\ \] \\ Thus, the probability that the marbles picked are of the same color is: \\ \[ \\ \boxed{B} \\ \]
