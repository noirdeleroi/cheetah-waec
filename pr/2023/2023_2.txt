"Solve $1+\sqrt[3]{x-3}=4$. \\ Possible answers: \\ A. $30$ \\ B. $6$ \\ C. $12$ \\ D. $66$ \\ Correct answer: A" \\ \textbf{Solution.} To solve the equation \(1 + \sqrt[3]{x - 3} = 4\), we start by isolating the cube root term. \\ First, subtract 1 from both sides: \\ \[ \\ 1 + \sqrt[3]{x - 3} - 1 = 4 - 1 \\ \] \\ This simplifies to: \\ \[ \\ \sqrt[3]{x - 3} = 3 \\ \] \\ Next, we cube both sides to eliminate the cube root: \\ \[ \\ (\sqrt[3]{x - 3})^3 = 3^3 \\ \] \\ This simplifies to: \\ \[ \\ x - 3 = 27 \\ \] \\ Finally, we solve for \(x\) by adding 3 to both sides: \\ \[ \\ x - 3 + 3 = 27 + 3 \\ \] \\ Which simplifies to: \\ \[ \\ x = 30 \\ \] \\ Verification by substituting \(x = 30\) back into the original equation confirms the solution is correct. Therefore, the answer is \(\boxed{A}\).
