The radius of the sector is 7 cm, and the angle \( \angle MON \) is \( 60^\circ \). The shaded area is the region bounded by the points \( T \), \( M \), the arc \( MN \), and \( N \). \\ 1. **Calculate the area of the sector \( MON \)**: \\ \[ \\ \text{Area of sector} = \frac{60}{360} \times \pi \times 7^2 = \frac{1}{6} \times \frac{22}{7} \times 49 = \frac{154}{6} \approx 25.6667 \, \text{cm}^2 \\ \] \\ 2. **Calculate the area of triangle \( OTN \)**: \\ - \( OT \) is half of \( OM \) because \( T \) is the midpoint (since \( \triangle MON \) is equilateral): \\ \[ \\ OT = \frac{7}{2} = 3.5 \, \text{cm} \\ \] \\ - The height \( NT \) in the equilateral triangle \( \triangle MON \): \\ \[ \\ NT = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \times 7 \approx 6.062 \, \text{cm} \\ \] \\ - Area of \( \triangle OTN \): \\ \[ \\ \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times OT \times NT = \frac{1}{2} \times 3.5 \times 6.062 \approx 10.6085 \, \text{cm}^2 \\ \] \\ 3. **Subtract the area of triangle \( OTN \) from the area of the sector \( MON \)**: \\ \[ \\ \text{Shaded area} = 25.6667 - 10.6085 \approx 15.0582 \approx 15.1 \, \text{cm}^2 \\ \] \\ For part B, we need to find the equation of the line with x-intercept \( \frac{-3}{4} \) and y-intercept \( \frac{2}{7} \). \\ 1. **Use the intercept form of the line equation**: \\ \[ \\ \frac{x}{-\frac{3}{4}} + \frac{y}{\frac{2}{7}} = 1 \\ \] \\ 2. **Convert to slope-intercept form**: \\ - Multiply through by 6 to clear the denominators: \\ \[ \\ -8x + 21y = 6 \\ \] \\ - Solve for \( y \): \\ \[ \\ 21y = 8x + 6 \implies y = \frac{8}{21}x + \frac{2}{7} \\ \] \\ The final answers are: \\ - **A.** The area of the shaded portion is \(\boxed{15.1}\). \\ - **B.** The equation of the line is \( y = \frac{8}{21}x + \frac{2}{7} \), represented as \(\boxed{8,21,2,7}\).
