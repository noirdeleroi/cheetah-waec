"The price of a shoe was decreased by $22 \%$. If the new price is $\$ 27.3$. What is the original price? \\ Possible answers: \\ A. $\$ 62.30$ \\ B. $\$ 42.30$ \\ C. $\$ 72.00$ \\ D. $\$ 35.00$ \\ Correct answer: D" \\ \textbf{Solution.} The original price of the shoe can be found by recognizing that after a $22\%$ decrease, the new price (\$27.3) represents $78\%$ of the original price. Setting up the equation: \\ \[ \\ \text{Original Price} \times 0.78 = 27.3 \\ \] \\ Solving for the original price: \\ \[ \\ \text{Original Price} = \frac{27.3}{0.78} = 35 \\ \] \\ Verification: A $22\%$ decrease on \$35 is \$7.7, leading to a new price of \$35 - \$7.7 = \$27.3, which matches the given information. \\ **Answer: D. \$35.00**
