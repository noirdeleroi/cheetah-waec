"A notebook of length $15 ~cm$ was measured to be $16.8 ~cm$, calculate, correct to two decimal places, the percentage error in the measurement. \\ Possible answers: \\ A. $12.00\%$ \\ B. $11.71\%$ \\ C. $10.71\%$ \\ D. $11.21\%$ \\ Correct answer: A" \\ \textbf{Solution.} To calculate the percentage error in the measurement of the notebook's length, we use the formula: \\ \[ \\ \text{Percentage Error} = \left( \frac{|\text{Measured Value} - \text{Actual Value}|}{\text{Actual Value}} \right) \times 100 \\ \] \\ Given: \\ - Actual length = 15 cm \\ - Measured length = 16.8 cm \\ First, find the absolute error: \\ \[ \\ |16.8 - 15| = 1.8 \text{ cm} \\ \] \\ Next, divide the absolute error by the actual value: \\ \[ \\ \frac{1.8}{15} = 0.12 \\ \] \\ Convert this to a percentage by multiplying by 100: \\ \[ \\ 0.12 \times 100 = 12.00\% \\ \] \\ Thus, the percentage error, correct to two decimal places, is 12.00%. Therefore, the correct answer is: \\ \[ \\ \boxed{A} \\ \]
