"John was facing ${S35}^{\circ}$. If he turned $90^{\circ}$ in the anticlockwise direction, find his new direction. \\ Possible answers: \\ A.$\mathrm{S} 55^{\circ} \mathrm{E}$ \\ B. $\mathrm{S} 35^{\circ} \mathrm{W}$ \\ C. $\mathrm{N} 55^{\circ} \mathrm{E}$ \\ D. $\mathrm{N} 35^{\circ} \mathrm{W}$ \\ Correct answer: C" \\ \textbf{Solution.} John was initially facing S35°, which is interpreted as S35°E (35 degrees east of south). When he turns 90° anticlockwise (to his left), this direction is subtracted from his current bearing. \\ 1. **Initial Bearing**: S35°E corresponds to 145° in standard compass notation (180° - 35° = 145°). \\ 2. **Turn**: Subtracting 90° anticlockwise: \(145° - 90° = 55°\). \\ 3. **New Direction**: 55° from north towards east, which is **N55°E**. \\ **Answer**: C. \(\mathrm{N} 55^{\circ} \mathrm{E}\)
