"A. The sum of three numbers is $81$. The second number is twice the first, the third number is $6$ more than the second. Find the numbers. Write down the answer as $a,b,c$, where $a$ is the first number, $b$ is the second one, $c$ is the third one. \\ B. There are points $P(3, 5)$ and $Q(-5, 7)$ on the Cartesian plane such that $R(x, y)$ is the midpoint of $PQ$. Find the equation of the line that passes through $R$ and perpendicular to line $PQ$. Represent the answer as $y=ax+b$, write down the answer as $a,b$\" \\ \\ Correct answer: \\ 15,30,36\\ Correct answer: \\  4,10" \\ \textbf{Solution.} A. The three numbers are found by setting up equations based on their relationships. Let the first number be \( a \). Then the second is \( 2a \), and the third is \( 2a + 6 \). Their sum is \( a + 2a + (2a + 6) = 81 \), leading to \( 5a + 6 = 81 \). Solving, \( 5a = 75 \) so \( a = 15 \). The numbers are \( 15, 30, 36 \). \\ **Answer:** 15,30,36 \\ B. The midpoint \( R \) of \( PQ \) is calculated as \( \left( \frac{3 + (-5)}{2}, \frac{5 + 7}{2} \right) = (-1, 6) \). The slope of \( PQ \) is \( \frac{7 - 5}{-5 - 3} = -\frac{1}{4} \). The perpendicular slope is \( 4 \). Using point-slope form with \( R(-1, 6) \): \( y - 6 = 4(x + 1) \), simplifying to \( y = 4x + 10 \). \\ **Answer:** 4,10
