Find the measure of the angle marked $t$. \\ Possible answers: \\ A. $72^{\circ}$ \\ B. $54^{\circ}$ \\ C. $36^{\circ}$ \\ D. $108^{\circ}$ \\ Correct answer: C" \\ \textbf{Solution.} Given a circle with center \( O \), point \( R \) is outside the circle, and tangents \( RM \) and \( RY \) touch the circle at points \( N \) and \( S \) respectively. Point \( T \) is on the circle such that \( \angle NTS = 36^\circ \) and \( NT = ST \). We need to find the angle \( \angle NSR \). \\ 1. **Properties of Tangents**: Since \( RM \) and \( RY \) are tangents from point \( R \), \( RN = RS \). Triangle \( RNS \) is isosceles with \( RN = RS \). \\ 2. **Alternate Segment Theorem**: The angle between a tangent and a chord at the point of contact is equal to the angle subtended by the chord in the alternate segment. For tangent \( RS \) and chord \( SN \), the angle \( \angle NSR \) is equal to the angle subtended by \( SN \) in the alternate segment. \\ 3. **Angle in the Alternate Segment**: Given \( \angle NTS = 36^\circ \) and \( NT = ST \), triangle \( NTS \) is isosceles with \( \angle NTS = 36^\circ \). The angle subtended by chord \( SN \) at point \( T \) in the alternate segment is \( 36^\circ \). \\ 4. **Applying the Theorem**: By the Alternate Segment Theorem, \( \angle NSR \) (the angle between tangent \( RS \) and chord \( SN \)) is equal to \( \angle NTS \), which is \( 36^\circ \). \\ Thus, the angle \( \angle NSR \) is \( \boxed{C} \).
