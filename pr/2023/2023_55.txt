"a. A boy stands at the point $M$ on the same horizontal level as the foot, $T$ of a vertical building. He observes an object on the top, $P$ of the building at an angle of elevation of $66^{\circ}$. He moves directly backward to a new point $C$ and observes the same object at an angle of $53^{\circ}$. If $|MT| = 50 ~m$: \\ Illustrate the information in a diagram; \\ bi. Calculate and correct to one decimal place: the height of the building; \\ bii. Calculate and correct to one decimal place: $|MC|$.\" \\ \\ Correct answer: \\ graph\\ Correct answer: \\  112.3\\ Correct answer: \\  34.6" \\ \textbf{Solution.} To solve the problem, we start by noting that the boy observes the top of the building from two different points, M and C, with angles of elevation 66째 and 53째 respectively. The distance from M to T is 50 meters. We need to find the height of the building (PT) and the distance from M to C (MC). \\ 1. **Height of the building (PT):** \\ - From point M, the angle of elevation to the top of the building P is 66째. Using the tangent function in triangle PMT: \\ \[ \\ \tan(66^\circ) = \frac{PT}{MT} \\ \] \\ Substituting \(MT = 50\) meters: \\ \[ \\ PT = 50 \times \tan(66^\circ) \\ \] \\ Using the value \(\tan(66^\circ) \approx 2.2460\): \\ \[ \\ PT \approx 50 \times 2.2460 \approx 112.3 \text{ meters} \\ \] \\ \begin{figure}[ht] \\ \centering \\ \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{/home/alex/Downloads/pics_waec/latex_code_solutions/2023_S_55.png} \\ \caption{} \\ \label{fig:1} \\ \end{figure} \\ 2. **Distance from M to C (MC):** \\ - From point C, the angle of elevation to the top of the building P is 53째. Using the tangent function in triangle PCT: \\ \[ \\ \tan(53^\circ) = \frac{PT}{CT} \\ \] \\ Here, \(CT = MT + MC = 50 + MC\). Substituting PT from the previous calculation: \\ \[ \\ PT = (50 + MC) \times \tan(53^\circ) \\ \] \\ Equating the two expressions for PT: \\ \[ \\ 50 \times \tan(66^\circ) = (50 + MC) \times \tan(53^\circ) \\ \] \\ Solving for MC: \\ \[ \\ MC = \frac{50 \times \tan(66^\circ)}{\tan(53^\circ)} - 50 \\ \] \\ Using the values \(\tan(66^\circ) \approx 2.2460\) and \(\tan(53^\circ) \approx 1.3270\): \\ \[ \\ MC \approx \frac{50 \times 2.2460}{1.3270} - 50 \approx \frac{112.3}{1.3270} - 50 \approx 84.624 - 50 \approx 34.6 \text{ meters} \\ \] \\ ### Final Answer \\ The height of the building is \boxed{112.3} meters and the distance \(|MC|\) is \boxed{34.6} meters.
