See the bar chart below. \\ Possible answers: \\ A. $58.5\%$ \\ B. $63.2\%$ \\ C. $38.3\%$ \\ D. $41.5\%$ \\ Correct answer: A" \\ \textbf{Solution.} To determine the percentage of students who scored at most 5 marks, we need to sum the frequencies for marks 1 through 5 and then find what percentage this total is of the overall number of students. \\ Given data: \\ - Mark 1: Frequency 3 \\ - Mark 2: Frequency 6 \\ - Mark 3: Frequency 9 \\ - Mark 4: Frequency 1 \\ - Mark 5: Frequency 12 \\ - Mark 6: Frequency 7 \\ - Mark 7: Frequency 5 \\ - Mark 8: Frequency 10 \\ First, calculate the sum of frequencies for marks 1 to 5: \\ \[ \\ 3 + 6 + 9 + 1 + 12 = 31 \\ \] \\ Next, calculate the total number of students by summing all frequencies from marks 1 to 8: \\ \[ \\ 3 + 6 + 9 + 1 + 12 + 7 + 5 + 10 = 53 \\ \] \\ To find the percentage of students who scored at most 5 marks: \\ \[ \\ \left( \frac{31}{53} \right) \times 100 \approx 58.5\% \\ \] \\ Thus, the correct answer is \(\boxed{A}\).
