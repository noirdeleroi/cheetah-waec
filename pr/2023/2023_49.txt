"$M$ varies jointly as the square of $n$ and square root of $q$. If $M=24$ when $n=2$ and $q=4$, find $M$ when $n=5, q=9$. \\ Possible answers: \\ A. $288$ \\ B. $400$ \\ C. $300$ \\ D. $225$ \\ Correct answer: D" \\ \textbf{Solution.} Given that \( M \) varies jointly as the square of \( n \) and the square root of \( q \), we can express this relationship as: \\ \[ M = k \cdot n^2 \cdot \sqrt{q} \] \\ where \( k \) is the constant of proportionality. \\ We are given that \( M = 24 \) when \( n = 2 \) and \( q = 4 \). Substituting these values into the equation to find \( k \): \\ \[ 24 = k \cdot (2)^2 \cdot \sqrt{4} \] \\ \[ 24 = k \cdot 4 \cdot 2 \] \\ \[ 24 = 8k \] \\ \[ k = \frac{24}{8} = 3 \] \\ Now that we have determined \( k = 3 \), the equation becomes: \\ \[ M = 3 \cdot n^2 \cdot \sqrt{q} \] \\ We need to find \( M \) when \( n = 5 \) and \( q = 9 \). Substituting these values into the equation: \\ \[ M = 3 \cdot (5)^2 \cdot \sqrt{9} \] \\ \[ M = 3 \cdot 25 \cdot 3 \] \\ \[ M = 3 \cdot 75 \] \\ \[ M = 225 \] \\ Thus, the final answer is \(\boxed{D}\).
