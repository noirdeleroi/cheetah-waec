See the bar chart below. \\ Possible answers: \\ A. $44$ \\ B. $52$ \\ C. $38$ \\ D. $18$ \\ Correct answer: A" \\ \textbf{Solution.} To determine how many students scored at least 3 marks, we need to sum the frequencies of the bars corresponding to marks 3 through 8. The given frequencies are as follows: \\ - Mark 3: 9 \\ - Mark 4: 1 \\ - Mark 5: 12 \\ - Mark 6: 7 \\ - Mark 7: 5 \\ - Mark 8: 10 \\ Adding these frequencies together step by step: \\ \[ \\ 9 \ (\text{Mark 3}) + 1 \ (\text{Mark 4}) = 10 \\ \] \\ \[ \\ 10 + 12 \ (\text{Mark 5}) = 22 \\ \] \\ \[ \\ 22 + 7 \ (\text{Mark 6}) = 29 \\ \] \\ \[ \\ 29 + 5 \ (\text{Mark 7}) = 34 \\ \] \\ \[ \\ 34 + 10 \ (\text{Mark 8}) = 44 \\ \] \\ Thus, the total number of students who scored at least 3 marks is \(\boxed{A}\).
