"The angle of elevation of the top of a building from a point $Z$ on the ground is $50^{\circ}$. If the height of the building is $124 ~m$, find the distance from $Z$ to the foot of the building. \\ Possible answers: \\ A. $147.78 ~m$ \\ B. $104.05 ~m$ \\ C. $161.87 ~m$ \\ D. $192.91 ~m$ \\ Correct answer: B" \\ \textbf{Solution.} To find the distance from point \( Z \) to the foot of the building, we use the tangent of the angle of elevation. The height of the building is the opposite side of the right triangle, and the distance we need to find is the adjacent side. \\ Given: \\ - Angle of elevation: \( 50^\circ \) \\ - Height of the building (opposite side): \( 124 \) meters \\ We use the tangent function: \\ \[ \\ \tan(50^\circ) = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{adjacent}} = \frac{124}{\text{distance}} \\ \] \\ \begin{figure}[ht] \\ \centering \\ \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{/home/alex/Downloads/pics_waec/latex_code_solutions/2023_S_6.png} \\ \caption{} \\ \label{fig:1} \\ \end{figure} \\ Rearranging to solve for the distance: \\ \[ \\ \text{distance} = \frac{124}{\tan(50^\circ)} \\ \] \\ Calculating \( \tan(50^\circ) \approx 1.191753592 \): \\ \[ \\ \text{distance} = \frac{124}{1.191753592} \approx 104.05 \\ \] \\ Thus, the distance from \( Z \) to the foot of the building is \(\boxed{B}\).
