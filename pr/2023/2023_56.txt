A shop owner gave an end-of-year bonus to two of his attendees, Kontor and Gapson in the ratio of their ages. Gapson's age is one and a half times that of Kontor who is $20$ years old.

(ii) Find Gapson's amount.\" \\ \\ Correct answer: \\ 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20\\ Correct answer: \\  3,10\\ Correct answer: \\  1,5\\ Correct answer: \\  500000\\ Correct answer: \\  300000" \\ \textbf{Solution.} To solve part A, we start with the inequality \(2n - 3 \leq 37\). Solving for \(n\): \\ \[ \\ 2n - 3 \leq 37 \implies 2n \leq 40 \implies n \leq 20 \\ \] \\ Thus, the set \(M\) contains all counting numbers from 1 to 20: \\ \[ \\ M = \{1, 2, 3, \ldots, 20\} \\ \] \\ Next, we determine the probability that a randomly selected number from \(M\) is a multiple of 3. The multiples of 3 in \(M\) are 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, and 18, which gives 6 numbers. The probability is: \\ \[ \\ \frac{6}{20} = \frac{3}{10} \implies \boxed{3,10} \\ \] \\ For the probability that a randomly selected number from \(M\) is a factor of 10, the factors of 10 in \(M\) are 1, 2, 5, and 10, which gives 4 numbers. The probability is: \\ \[ \\ \frac{4}{20} = \frac{1}{5} \implies \boxed{1,5} \\ \] \\ For part B, Kontor is 20 years old and Gapson is 1.5 times older, so Gapson is 30 years old. The ratio of their ages is 20:30, which simplifies to 2:3. Kontor received 200,000 Le, which corresponds to 2 parts of the total amount. Each part is: \\ \[ \\ \frac{200,000}{2} = 100,000 \\ \] \\ The total amount shared is: \\ \[ \\ 5 \times 100,000 = 500,000 \implies \boxed{500000} \\ \] \\ Gapson's amount is: \\ \[ \\ 3 \times 100,000 = 300,000 \implies \boxed{300000} \\ \] \\ ### Final Answer \\ A. Elements of \(M\): \boxed{1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20} \\ Probability of multiple of 3: \boxed{3,10} \\ Probability of factor of 10: \boxed{1,5} \\ B. (i) Total amount: \boxed{500000} \\ B. (ii) Gapson's amount: \boxed{300000}
