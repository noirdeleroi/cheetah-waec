"The $x$ and $y$ intercepts of a straight line are $\frac{-3}{4}$ and $\frac{2}{7}$ respectively. Find the equation of the line. Represent the answer as $y=\frac{a}{b}x+\frac{c}{d}$, where $a,b,c,d$ are integers, write down the answer as $a,b,c,d$.\" \\ \\ Correct answer: \\ 8,21,2,7" \\ \textbf{Solution.} Given the x-intercept \(\frac{-3}{4}\) and y-intercept \(\frac{2}{7}\) of a straight line, we need to find its equation in the form \(y = \frac{a}{b}x + \frac{c}{d}\). \\ 1. **Using the intercept form of a line**: The intercept form is \(\frac{x}{a} + \frac{y}{b} = 1\), where \(a\) is the x-intercept and \(b\) is the y-intercept. Substituting the given intercepts: \\ \[ \\ \frac{x}{-\frac{3}{4}} + \frac{y}{\frac{2}{7}} = 1 \\ \] \\ Simplifying the denominators by multiplying by their reciprocals: \\ \[ \\ -\frac{4}{3}x + \frac{7}{2}y = 1 \\ \] \\ 2. **Solving for \(y\)**: \\ \[ \\ \frac{7}{2}y = \frac{4}{3}x + 1 \\ \] \\ Multiplying both sides by \(\frac{2}{7}\): \\ \[ \\ y = \left(\frac{4}{3} \times \frac{2}{7}\right)x + \left(1 \times \frac{2}{7}\right) \\ \] \\ Simplifying the terms: \\ \[ \\ y = \frac{8}{21}x + \frac{2}{7} \\ \] \\ 3. **Verification using slope-intercept form**: \\ - The slope \(m\) between points \(\left(-\frac{3}{4}, 0\right)\) and \(\left(0, \frac{2}{7}\right)\) is: \\ \[ \\ m = \frac{\frac{2}{7} - 0}{0 - \left(-\frac{3}{4}\right)} = \frac{\frac{2}{7}}{\frac{3}{4}} = \frac{8}{21} \\ \] \\ - Using the y-intercept \(\frac{2}{7}\), the equation is: \\ \[ \\ y = \frac{8}{21}x + \frac{2}{7} \\ \] \\ 4. **Checking intercepts**: \\ - For the x-intercept (\(y = 0\)): \\ \[ \\ 0 = \frac{8}{21}x + \frac{2}{7} \implies x = -\frac{3}{4} \\ \] \\ - For the y-intercept (\(x = 0\)): \\ \[ \\ y = \frac{2}{7} \\ \] \\ Thus, the equation of the line is \(y = \frac{8}{21}x + \frac{2}{7}\). The integers \(a, b, c, d\) are \(8, 21, 2, 7\). \\ \[ \\ \boxed{8,21,2,7} \\ \]
