If the failed mark was $4$, what is the probability that a student selected at random passed? \\ Possible answers: \\ A. $0.36$ \\ B. $0.74$ \\ C. $0.52$ \\ D. $0.64$ \\ Correct answer: D" \\ \textbf{Solution.} To determine the probability that a randomly selected student passed the economics examination, we need to consider the given data distribution and the definition of the failed mark. The failed mark is 4, which means students who scored 4 or below failed, while those who scored above 4 passed. \\ The frequencies of the marks are as follows: \\ - Mark 1: 3 students \\ - Mark 2: 6 students \\ - Mark 3: 9 students \\ - Mark 4: 1 student \\ - Mark 5: 12 students \\ - Mark 6: 7 students \\ - Mark 7: 5 students \\ - Mark 8: 10 students \\ First, we calculate the number of students who failed (marks 1 to 4): \\ \[ \\ 3 + 6 + 9 + 1 = 19 \\ \] \\ Next, we calculate the number of students who passed (marks 5 to 8): \\ \[ \\ 12 + 7 + 5 + 10 = 34 \\ \] \\ The total number of students is the sum of all frequencies: \\ \[ \\ 3 + 6 + 9 + 1 + 12 + 7 + 5 + 10 = 53 \\ \] \\ The probability that a randomly selected student passed is the ratio of the number of passing students to the total number of students: \\ \[ \\ \frac{34}{53} \approx 0.6415 \\ \] \\ Given the closest answer option, the probability is approximately 0.64. \\ \[ \\ \boxed{D} \\ \]
