    <h3>1.8 Ratio and Proportion</h3>
<strong>Key Concepts:</strong>
<ul>
    <li> <strong>Ratio:</strong> A ratio compares two or more quantities using division. It can be written as \( a : b \), which means \( \frac{a}{b} \).
    <li> <strong>Simplifying Ratios:</strong> Ratios can be simplified by dividing all terms by their greatest common divisor (GCD).
    <li> <strong>Proportion:</strong> Two quantities are said to be <strong>proportional</strong> if one quantity is a constant multiple of the other. In direct proportionality, as one quantity increases, the other increases at the same rate, and this relationship can be expressed as \( y \propto x \) or \( y = kx \), where \( k \) is the constant of proportionality. Conversely, two quantities are <strong>inversely proportional</strong> if one quantity increases while the other decreases such that their product remains constant. This relationship is expressed as \( y \propto \frac{1}{x} \) or \( y = \frac{k}{x} \), where \( k \) is the constant of proportionality.
    <li> <strong>Cross Multiplication:</strong> Used to solve proportions:
    \[
    \frac{a}{b} = \frac{c}{d} \Rightarrow a \cdot d = b \cdot c
    \]
    <li> <strong>Speed, Distance, and Time:</strong> In proportional problems, use the relationship:
    \[
    \text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Time}}
    \]
    <li> <strong>Converting Between Fractions, Decimals, and Percentages:</strong>  
    - Fraction to percentage: multiply by 100  
    - Decimal to percentage: multiply by 100  
    - Percentage to decimal: divide by 100
</ul>
<strong>Example 1: Solve the ratio \(\frac{2}{5} = \frac{x}{15}\).</strong>
Step 1: Cross multiply the terms in the equation:
\[
2 \cdot 15 = 5 \cdot x.
\]
Step 2: Simplify the multiplication:
\[
30 = 5x.
\]
Step 3: Solve for  x:
\[
x = \frac{30}{5} = 6.
\]
Therefore, \(x = 6\).
<strong>Example 2: Three boys shared D 10,500.00 in the ratio 6:7:8. Find the largest share.</strong>
Step 1: Find the total ratio:
\[
6 + 7 + 8 = 21.
\]
Step 2: Divide the total amount by the total ratio to find the value of one part:
\[
\text{Value of one part} = \frac{10,500}{21} = 500.
\]
Step 3: Find the largest share:
\[
\text{Largest share} = 8 \times 500 = 4,000.
\]
Therefore, the largest share is D 4,000.
<strong>Example 3: Given that \(P \propto \frac{1}{\sqrt{r}}\) and \(P = 3\) when \(r = 16\), find the value of \(r\) when \(P = \frac{3}{2}\).</strong>
Solution:
Step 1: Express \(P\) in terms of \(r\) using the proportionality constant \(k\):
\[
P = \frac{k}{\sqrt{r}}.
\]
Step 2: Substitute \(P = 3\) and \(r = 16\) to find \(k\):
\[
3 = \frac{k}{\sqrt{16}}.
\]
\[
3 = \frac{k}{4}.
\]
\[
k = 3 \times 4 = 12.
\]
Step 3: Use \(k = 12\) and \(P = \frac{3}{2}\) to find \(r\):
\[
\frac{3}{2} = \frac{12}{\sqrt{r}}.
\]
\[
\sqrt{r} = \frac{12}{\frac{3}{2}}.
\]
\[
\sqrt{r} = \frac{12 \times 2}{3} = 8.
\]
Step 4: Square both sides to find \(r\):
\[
r = 8^2 = 64.
\]
Therefore, the value of \(r\) when \(P = \frac{3}{2}\) is \(64\).
